# i3-pywal

This repository is a continuation of [lightweight-i3-config](https://github.com/POP303U/lightweight-i3-config)  
and the prequel to my personal Hyprland configuration!  

## **How to Install**  

Run the following command in your terminal to start the installer:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/POP303U/i3-pywal
cd i3-pywal
./install
```

Make sure to authorize `sudo` if prompted.  

***Done!***  


## **Current Setup**

## **Troubleshooting**  

- If your weather module isn't displaying the correct temperature, make sure to manually set the ```ZIPCODE``` variable in ```~/.config/polybar/scripts/weather_script.sh``` to match your location.
- If errors occur like no transparency or broken animations try to disable picom (picom doesn't work well with old graphic cards).
- Be prepared to read error messages and search online if you donâ€™t understand something.  
- I recommend having at least some experience with i3 and linux before using my configuration.  

## **Usage**  

These files are free for anyone to use. However, credit must be given if you publish my config or a modified version of it.  

Have fun customizing your setup!
