Personal dotfiles
This repository contains the continuation of [lightweight-i3-config](https://github.com/POP303U/lightweight-i3-config)!
And prequel to my personal Hyprland config!

**How to install**

Paste this code into your nearest terminal to get started with the installer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/POP303U/i3-pywal
cd i3-pywal/setup-i3
./install
```

Make sure you authorise sudo if you are prompted to.

***Done!***

## **Current Setup!**

**Troubleshooting**

If errors occur (no transparency, no statusbar, etc...) look at the neccessary packages!
Be ready to read errors and google if you don't understand something.
Read the documentation and the many config guides. I recommend you have at least some experience before trying my configs.

**Use**

These files are free of use for anybody, however credit must be given if my config / modified config is posted.
Have fun customizing your own!
