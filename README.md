# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles
This repository contains the continuation of [lightweight-i3-config](https://github.com/POP303U/lightweight-i3-config)!
And prequel to my personal Hyprland config!

**How to install**

Paste this code into your nearest terminal to get started with the installer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/POP303U/i3-pywal
cd i3-pywal/setup-i3
./install
```

You don't have to clone the repo twice if you want to install both i3 and Hyprland
just go to the setup folder corresponding for your install and run the installer!

Select your profile to install and you're ready to go!

***Done!***

## **Current Setup!**

**Troubleshooting**

If errors occur (no transparency, no statusbar, etc...) look at the neccessary packages!
Be ready to read errors and google if you don't understand something.
Read the documentation and the many config guides. I recommend you have at least some experience before trying my configs.

**Use**

These files are free of use for anybody, however credit must be given if my config / modified config is posted.
Have fun customizing your own!
