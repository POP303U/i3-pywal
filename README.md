# i3-pywal

This repository is a continuation of [lightweight-i3-config](https://github.com/POP303U/lightweight-i3-config)  
and the prequel to my personal Hyprland configuration!  

## **How to Install**  

Run the following command in your terminal to start the installer:  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/POP303U/i3-pywal
cd i3-pywal/setup-i3
./install
```

Make sure to authorize `sudo` if prompted.  

***Done!***  

## **Current Setup**

## **Troubleshooting**  

If errors occur (e.g., no transparency, no status bar, etc.), check if all necessary packages are installed.  
Be prepared to read error messages and search online if you donâ€™t understand something.  
I recommend having at least some experience before using my configurations.  

## **Usage**  

These files are free for anyone to use. However, credit must be given if you publish my config or a modified version of it.  

Have fun customizing your setup!
